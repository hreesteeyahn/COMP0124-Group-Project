# COMP0124-Group-Project

### Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that represents a simulation project involving policy learning agents in a Cleanup SSD game environment. The simulation demonstrates how agents can learn and interact within a virtual environment to perform tasks like collecting apples and cleaning waste in a 2D environment.

### Files

**cleanup.ipynb** - This notebook sets up the Cleanup simulation environment and the agents.

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.8** or higher
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**
- Libraries:
  - **NumPy**
  - **Matplotlib** (optional, for visualization)
  - **imageio** (optional, for creating visual outputs of the simulation)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Jupyter**: If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib imageio
   ```

4. **Download the Notebooks**: Download the `cleanup.ipynb` and `cleanup-with-q-agent.ipynb` from this repository to your local machine.

### Running the Notebooks
1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks and run:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the Desired Notebook**: In the Jupyter interface, click on the notebook file you wish to open (`cleanup.ipynb` or `cleanup-with-q-agent.ipynb`).

3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells sequentially by pressing `Shift + Enter` on each cell or using the "Run All" option from the toolbar to execute all cells in the notebook.
